## Complete DevOps Pipeline

Test --> Build --> Deploy --> Configure --> Monitor

## Software Development Life cycle

Plan --> Implement --> Test --> Deploy --> Maintain 

- programming
- software testing
- operation
 - build application
 - run on server
 - upgrade existing software 

### development 
- programming
- test framework
- database
- version control

### operation
- os, mostly Linux
- command line 
- scripting
- monitoring tools

## Waterfall vs Agile

## Operating system

### Intro to operating system
